Adds a "Flush Rewrite Rules" button to WP-Admin > Settings > Permalinks.


== Description ==

It was brought to my attention shortly after releasing this plugin that WordPress automatically flushes
rewrite rules when you visit WP-Admin > Settings > Permalinks. Ingenious, right? So don't bother installing it,
but feel free to check out the code if you are looking for an example of how to:

1. Use the WordPress Settings API to add an option to an existing Settings page;
2. Use the WordPress AJAX API in conjunction with your plugin options;
3. Over-engineer a solution to a problem that has already been solved.

Enjoy! :-)


== Installation ==

1. Don't install.
2. See plugin description.


== Screenshots ==

1. A `Flush Rewrite Rules` button is added to WP-Admin > Settings > Permalinks.
